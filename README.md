## New: IPsec for the underlay tunnel (proof of concept)

Underlay tunnel traffic can be encrypted with ESP, enabled at runtime with `--enable-ipsec`.
See [docs/concepts/ipsec.md](/docs/concepts/ipsec.md) for the full concept.

- ESP (AES-GCM, RFC 4106) over the existing IPv6 tunnel, framed by `librte_ipsec`; two new
  graph nodes, `ipsec_encap` and `ipsec_decap`. Refused together with hardware offloading.
- Security Associations are provisioned at runtime over gRPC - `Create`/`Get`/`DeleteSecurityAssociation`,
  also in `dpservice-cli`. See [the gRPC interface](/docs/concepts/ipsec.md#the-grpc-interface).
- Per-association **anti-replay window** (`replay_window`, ingress only, max 4096, off by default).
- Per-association **extended sequence numbers** (`esn`, RFC 4304, off by default) and a choice of
  **AES-128-GCM or AES-256-GCM** (`algorithm`), both covered in each direction by the test suite.
- An association is named by its **VNI, SPI, direction and underlay address pair**, and all five
  are matched. What it is found under depends on the direction - the VNI on egress, since a packet
  is not ESP yet and has no SPI to read, and the SPI on ingress - so the value in the ESP header
  is free of the VNI. See [ADR 0004](/docs/adr/0004-the-lookup-spi-is-not-the-wire-spi.md).
- An **ingress association is bound to its VNI**: `ipsec_decap` resolves the endpoint the frame is
  addressed at and drops it if that endpoint belongs to another tenant, so one association does not
  authorise delivery into every interface on the host. See
  [ADR 0005](/docs/adr/0005-ingress-associations-are-bound-to-their-vni.md).
- Tested dpservice-to-dpservice: a full encrypted round trip against a scapy peer holding a
  different key per direction, with the SAs installed over gRPC by the test itself.
- Tested dpservice-to-Linux: `xtratest_ipsec_xfrm.py` runs the same round trip against a kernel
  XFRM peer in a namespace, and requires every `/proc/net/xfrm_stat` counter to stay zero.
- The replay window is exercised both ways: a replayed frame is asserted to be dropped against
  the scapy peer, and the XFRM round trip runs with a window of 64 to prove it interoperates.
- [`ipsec-xfrm/`](/ipsec-xfrm) - standalone Linux XFRM scripts demonstrating a per-VNI IPsec mesh
  with **SPI = VNI**, in network namespaces, independent of dpservice.
- Builds and runs in Docker: `docker build --target tester` gives an image whose `ipsec` suite
  runs alongside all the others.


## Overview

Dataplane Service in short form dpservice is a L3 virtual router with basic L2 capabilites and with IP in IPv6 tunneling for the uplink traffic. It uses [SRIOV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-root_input/output_virtualization) based Virtual Functions as its virtual ports. A virtual machine or a bare metal machine (In case dpservice running directly on SmartNIC) can be plugged to SRIOV VFs.

- It can operate in offloaded and non-offloaded mode.
  - Offload mode means first packet of each flow flowing over dpservice will be handled in software and then the flow will be offloaded to the hardware. (Using [DPDK](https://core.dpdk.org/doc/) rte_flow)
  - Non-offloaded mode handles the whole traffic in software using [PMD](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/prog_guide/poll_mode_drv.html) drivers and dedicated CPU cores.

- Uses [DPDK Graph Framework](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/prog_guide/graph_lib.html) for the data plane.
- [rte_flow](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/prog_guide/rte_flow.html) offloading between the Virtual Machines(VMs) on a single hypervisor and ip in ipv6 decap/encap offloading between hypervisors.
- GRPC support to add virtual network interfaces and routes. There is a C++ based GRPC
  test client (CLI) which can connect to the GRPC server. See the examples under [docs](/docs).
- There is also a golang based [GRPC client](https://github.com/ironcore-dev/dpservice/tree/main/cli/dpservice-cli) which is easier to use.
- A kubernetes controller abstraction on top of the provided GRPC interface is availiable as well. It is called [metalnet](https://github.com/ironcore-dev/metalnet).
- DHCPv4, DHCPv6, Neighbour Discovery, ARP protocols supported (Sub-set implementations.).
- IPv4 and IPv6 overlay support.
- Virtual IP support for the virtual network interfaces.
- Loadbalancer support with maglev hashing.
- Horizantally scalable NAT Gateway support.
- Automated test support with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and [scapy](https://scapy.net/).
